\maketitle

In this project, we build an electronic version of the Canadian electoral system which is based
on a parliamentary system of government, modelled on that of the United Kingdom. The
people
in each electoral district vote for a candidate of their choice. The candidate who
receives the
most votes becomes Members of Parliament (MP) for that electoral district. After an election, the party with the most elected
representatives
becomes the party in power.


\section{System Architecture}

The Real-Time Electronic Voting System is programmed in Java as a distributed Client-Server
system. A number of Clients connect to servers which are representative of their local
electoral district. The Client systems are of a MVC architecture, and act as a polling
station for voters to register and vote once for their chosen candidate and party. The
client software allows voters to see the current statistics of the election in
real-time, and register and vote by validating with a local District Server. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
The District Servers processes all communication with the Clients in their district. They
store and validate the Client's registration, votes, and compute statistics on those
votes. A voter may only register through the Client once, and they need to login with the
server in order to vote. Once they have voted, the District Server will not allow
them to vote again.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The DistrictServers connect to a single CentralServer, which updates the entire federal election
results in soft real-time. The Central Server queries all of the District Servers
periodically for their current electoral statistics, and uses these statistics to compute
the results of the federal election. That is, it determines which party has the most votes
nation-wide. The system's distributed Client-Server architecture is depicted in
\underline{Figure 1.1} below. \\

\section{Java Class Implementation}

The System is implemented over a collection of Java classes, which are organized into Java
packages. The packages are {\tt controller}, {\tt model}, {\tt networking}, and {\tt
view}. The package organization corresponds to a typical Model-View-Controller design. 
With in the controller package, we see that there are implemented controller classes for the 
district server, central server, and client.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The server controllers use the networking components
to listen for connetions, and send and receive messages of specific types. For example the {\tt receiveMessages}
method in {\tt DistrictServer} receives a message from a client over the classes provided in the networking packages, 
checks the type of message received by looking at the message header, and handles the request accordingly. 
Both the district and central servers are mutli-threaded to concurrently handle clients in separate threads. 
The district server, however, enforces a configurable upper bound on the number client threads, while the 
central server does not since there are only a limited number of districts that it will be connected to.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The networking framework contains a {\tt WSocket} and {\tt WServerSocket} class which are intended to simulate 
the {\tt Socket} and {\tt ServerSocket} TCP connection classes contained in the {\tt java.net} API.
A Message class is used for the transmission of data between these socket classes.
\vspace{2mm} \\
There is also a Model package which contains all the classes to represent the data entities used by the 
Real-Time Electronic Voting System. For example the Voter class encapsulates the necessary data about 
an actual user of the system such as their name, and SIN.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The View package contains a number of user interface components for users to interact with on the client program.
The view is initially started by the {\tt ClientController} in the controller package. The user is able, register,
login, vote, and view the electoral results of their local district as well as the results at the national level. This results
are updated periodically in soft real-time by the {\tt ClientController}. 
\vspace{2mm} \\
Lastly, we have a testing framework which contains a number of JUnit tests to ensure that the general
usage of the system is handled correctly, and also that edge or invalid use cases are handled accordingly.
The {\tt SystemPopulator} provides a large amount of example data to populate the system for in depth testing.
For example, {\tt SystemPopulator} may generate a large number of Voters and have them cast Votes randomly for candidates.
The testing framework is not shown in the UML diagrams.
\vspace{2mm} \\
The classes contained within each package, and their relationships, are illustrated in the UML diagrams below.

\section{The Communications Protocol}

The system's communication protocol is handled by a networking subsystem that
simulates the TCP protocol over a UDP connection. The idea with this system
is to closely simulate the java TCP Socket and ServerSocket classes.
This networking component contains a
java class named, {\tt WSocket} (which stands for wrapper-socket). This class offers a
{\tt send} instance method which guarantees that message being passed are received by another
instance of {\tt WSocket}. It achieves this by sending a packet over a DatagramSocket, 
then waiting for another packet in response to signify that the data was received and intact. 
If no response is received, a {\tt TimeoutException} is thrown and the message is resent.
The {\tt WSocket} class also offers a {\tt receive} method, which blocks and waits for a message to be received
over a datagram socket. When the message is received, it is deserialized and a CRC
checksum is calculated on the contained data. If the checksum indicates that the data is
corrupted, it does not send any notification message back to the sender. This effectively
causes the sender to resend the same message, since they will timeout after not receiving
a response. If the data is intact, a notification message is sent back to the sender and
the deserialized message is returned to the receiver. 
\vspace{2mm}\\
There is another limitation of using a UDP connection; and that is that individual packets
can only transport a small amount of data. The {\tt WSocket} class therefore breaks messages
that exceed the size of one packet into fragments. Fragments are sent and received in order,
following the same protocol outlined above, then are pieced back together by the receiver
to reconstruct the initial message. This protocol is illustrated in the two sequence
diagrams below. \underline{Figure 3.1} shows how the protocol operates for the sender,
which may be a Client in the Real-Time Electronic Voting System, and {\underline Figure
3.2} shows the protocol as it works for
the receiver, which may be a server in the system. Note that the exception handling, in
particular, for the timeout and message-corrupted exceptions, are not shown in these
diagrams.
\vspace{2mm}\\
The networking systems also contains a {\tt WServerSocket} class which is analogous to the 
{\tt ServerSocket} class offered in the default {\tt java.net} API. The {\tt WServerSocket}
listens for new client connections on a specified port using the {\tt accept()} method.
When a client connects, this method returns a new {\tt WSocket} connected to the client
on any available port. The protocol for the {\tt WServerSocket} is outlined in the sequence diagram
shown in \underline{Figure 3.3}. This class is useful for servers with many concurrent client connections.

\noindent More specifically, the Real-Time Electronic Voting System uses the networking subsystem to
send a finite set of message types between the clients, district servrs, and central server.
. A typical interaction between a Client and District
Server may involve sending an odered sequence of messages. For example, a Client will
first request the list candidates running in that district. A voter may then
register with the District Server, then login, before they can send their vote.
Meanwhile, a background thread started by the Client periodically pings the current
election results from the server. This typical interaction is shown in the sequenec
diagram below.
